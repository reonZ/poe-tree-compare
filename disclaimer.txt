Disclaimer:

I am using the json files provided by GGG as is, therefore, any changes made after the release of said files during the league are not accounted for.

I don't have any way to keep track of them.

So it is possible that some changes tracked here may have already been part of the last iteration of the skilltree and not really from the new league balance.
