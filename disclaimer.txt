This is the result of both 3.12 and 3.13 json skilltree files parsed and ran against each others giving us which nodes were modified, added and removed.

Due to some mistake, I lost my original parser and webpage formatting and had to rewrite it in a hurry, I could not remember all the manual modifications I had made while parsing the file so you might encounter some mistakes.

Disclaimer:

I am using the json files provided by GGG as is, therefore, any changes made after the release of said files during the league are not accounted for.

I don't have any way to keep track of them.

So it is possible that some changes tracked here may have already been part of the last iteration of the skilltree and not really from the new league balance.
